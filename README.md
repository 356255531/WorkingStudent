# GPU Based Visual Navigation Implementation on Raspberry Pi 3

This repository includes the research materials and gpu based computer vision task implementations e.g. the basic program framework from @Chris Cummings (http://robotblogging.blogspot.de/2013/10/gpu-accelerated-camera-processing-on.html) wand visual navigation project of chair navigation and communication (Technical University of Munich) as well as the official demo from userland.

## dependency
All you need is to build and install the source files from userland (https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland).
But you of course need to have git.

## Usage
We are currently working an the project directory and a robust harris detector were implemented there.
You have the full functionality by input the following code:
    git clone git@github.com:356255531/WorkingStudent.git
    cd WorkingStudent/Project/
    build .
    make
    ./picam

For another demo program just enter the folder and play around.
